# Data Structures and Algorithms
- #### Language you will be using
	- CPP (from love babbar playlist)
	- Java ( once your are confident in it and learnt it enough from youtube videos)

# Web Development
- #### Framework you will learn
	- Spring boot 
- #### What you have to do
	- I will find the playlist actually because I myself have done it from various sources and yeah right now I'm following an intermediate udemy course , I will tell you about a beginner one where it will teach Java also.
	- You will go with the course and watch each video and try to code side by side , (side by side is mandatory and try to think why he did that specific thing, try to play with the code)

# To become a hot mum

	- lots of cardio 
	- lots of eating so you don't lose fat from good areas
